href=\"https://www.python.org/\">Python</a> in <a href=\"https://go.java/index.html\">Java</a>,\\nproviding to Python the benefits of running on the JVM and access to classes written in Java.\\nThe current release (a Jython 2.7.x) only supports Python 2 (sorry).\\nThere is work towards a Python 3 in the project\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GitHub repository.</p>\\n\\n<p>Jython implementations are freely available for both commercial and non-commercial use.\\nThey are distributed with source code under the <a href=\"https://github.com/jython/jython/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\">PSF License v2</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Jython is complementary to Java and is especially suited for the following tasks:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>Embedded scripting - Java programmers can add the Jython libraries to their system to allow end users to write simple or complicated scripts that add functionality to the application.</li>\\n  <li>Interactive experimentation - Jython provides an interactive interpreter that can be used to interact with Java packages or with running Java applications. This allows programmers to experiment and debug any Java system using Jython.</li>\\n  <li>Rapid application development - Python programs are typically 2-10x shorter than the equivalent Java program. This translates directly to increased programmer productivity. The seamless interaction between Python and Java allows developers to freely mix the two languages both during development and in shipping products.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h5 id=\"here-is-an-example-of-running-python-code-inside-a-simple-java-application\">Here is an example of running Python code inside a simple Java application</h5>\\n<div class=\"language-java highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">org.python.util.PythonInterpreter</span><span class=\"o\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">JythonHelloWorld</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">static</span> <span class=\"kt\">void</span> <span class=\"nf\">main</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">String</span><span class=\"o\">[]</span> <span class=\"n\">args</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\"k\">try</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">PythonInterpreter</span> <span class=\"n\">pyInterp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nc\">PythonInterpreter</span><span class=\"o\">())</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\"n\">pyInterp</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">exec</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"print(\\'Hello Python World!\\')\"</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\\n    <span class=\"o\">}</span>\\n  <span class=\"o\">}</span>\\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\\n</code></pre></div></div>\\n<h5 id=\"here-is-an-example-of-using-java-from-python-code\">Here is an example of using Java from Python code</h5>\\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">java.lang</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">System</span> <span class=\"c1\"># Java import\\n</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\\'Running on Java version: \\'</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">System</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">getProperty</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\\'java.version\\'</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\\'Unix time from Java: \\'</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">System</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">currentTimeMillis</span><span class=\"p\">()))</span>\\n</code></pre></div></div>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting Started</h2>\\n\\n<p>Ready to get started?

href=\"https://www.python.org/\">Python</a> in <a href=\"https://go.java/index.html\">Java</a>,\\nproviding to Python the benefits of running on the JVM and access to classes written in Java.\\nThe current release (a Jython 2.7.x) only supports Python 2 (sorry).\\nThere is work towards a Python 3 in the project\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GitHub repository.</p>\\n\\n<p>Jython implementations are freely available for both commercial and non-commercial use.\\nThey are distributed with source code under the <a href=\"https://github.com/jython/jython/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\">PSF License v2</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Jython is complementary to Java and is especially suited for the following tasks:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>Embedded scripting - Java programmers can add the Jython libraries to their system to allow end users to write simple or complicated scripts that add functionality to the application.</li>\\n  <li>Interactive experimentation - Jython provides an interactive interpreter that can be used to interact with Java packages or with running Java applications. This allows programmers to experiment and debug any Java system using Jython.</li>\\n  <li>Rapid application development - Python programs are typically 2-10x shorter than the equivalent Java program. This translates directly to increased programmer productivity. The seamless interaction between Python and Java allows developers to freely mix the two languages both during development and in shipping products.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h5 id=\"here-is-an-example-of-running-python-code-inside-a-simple-java-application\">Here is an example of running Python code inside a simple Java application</h5>\\n<div class=\"language-java highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">org.python.util.PythonInterpreter</span><span class=\"o\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">JythonHelloWorld</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\\n  <span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">static</span> <span class=\"kt\">void</span> <span class=\"nf\">main</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">String</span><span class=\"o\">[]</span> <span class=\"n\">args</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\"k\">try</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">PythonInterpreter</span> <span class=\"n\">pyInterp</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nc\">PythonInterpreter</span><span class=\"o\">())</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\\n      <span class=\"n\">pyInterp</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">exec</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"print(\\'Hello Python World!\\')\"</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\\n    <span class=\"o\">}</span>\\n  <span class=\"o\">}</span>\\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\\n</code></pre></div></div>\\n<h5 id=\"here-is-an-example-of-using-java-from-python-code\">Here is an example of using Java from Python code</h5>\\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">java.lang</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">System</span> <span class=\"c1\"># Java import\\n</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\\'Running on Java version: \\'</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">System</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">getProperty</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\\'java.version\\'</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\\n<span class=\"k\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\\'Unix time from Java: \\'</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">System</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">currentTimeMillis</span><span class=\"p\">()))</span>\\n</code></pre></div></div>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting Started</h2>\\n\\n<p>Ready to get started?

    "### 10.1. Overview about experiences/ project\n",
    "- VNG:\n",
    "    - when it comes to VNG, in VNG bassically I invovled in project as the game developer, within the time I was employeed here, I join 3 game porjects, mainly performing the clien-side with specific framework cocoJS, mainly using JS as programming language. Besides that, I also participated in data team, technichly, I implemented data preprocessing and data visualization for all the international game of the teams, supporting carry out the report for each week and month, joined to analysis data and gave advices. Not but not least, I also constructed a classification model to predict the churn pay label, and it was quite effective while i raised the 1% payrate when applied\n",
    "\n",
    "- Research asssitant in HUST:\n",
    "    - First of all, I joint the project to build a website that could interact with the DICOM image which is a medical image standard to store patient information and doctors interaction into an image. At that moment, I did use ReactJS as the front-end framework to create a catchy and responsive user interface with the support of cornerstoneJS dependency.\n",
    "        - In this project, I face a lot of problems. For example, the unlimited increase of re-rendering times or  the time cost for first time open the website or blocking user interact wehn switching between tabs.\n",
    "            - For each problem I pointed out that because of the lack of using hook and experiences when dealing with ReactJS.\n",
    "                - To solve the unlimited increas of re-rendering times, it was a lil bit tricky, i have to re-define the state of each component and add more useEffect with specific state, to reduce the calculation between re-renderings. And especially, at that moment, I put a lot of logic in the useEffect like, fetching data from external system or re-calculate other state, but when dived deeper into ReactJS i relized that useEffect was only for fetching data so i have to refactor almost all the codes that i wrote. and use useRef for the alternative solution for caching data the not use for re-rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "                - Secondly, i point out that when first time opening the website, it will load all other components that was imported into the website. the solution here, i knew that it not means that i have to load all the component at one time, i have just splitted it to quickly load what i want to see at that moment, so i use the lazy load, it helped the website to load the component when first time i want to see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "                - Lastly, i met a problem that whenever i switch to the tab that had to fetch the data from server, certainly, it fetched the DICOM image and do some logic to initialize the image, I couldnt interact with the UI until it finshed. so to deal with it, i used the useTransaction to mark the feching and update state process as a non-blocking transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Secondly, the target of the project was sent out a C++ library that easy to interact with the DICOM image and support DICOM network. In this part, i have to refactor some codes inside the project which been left by other students and write 2 class which were SCU and SCP class in DICOM network to communicate, quere/ retriute and store DICOM file. Basically, it was design on TCP socket based, so mainly i just had to open the socket and connect to the right IP and PORT that was opened to listen and using DCMTK the open-source library to manipulate the infomation sent through socket. It was a bit of tricky but with the support of the library, it was much more easier.\n",
    "    But at the end of the day, i still handled it well and the project was sent to the clien to examinize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Personal Project:\n",
    "    - Decentralized Blogging Platform: \n",
    "        - In this project, first my role in the project is just system designer and the back-end dev, just to write some smart contracts. But, as the time passed, because of the new framework front-end, thus my partner couldn't finish the UI on time, so i have to support and restructure the fe with my experiences, still at first, it still faced some kind of problems like my RA, after the studying, i managed it well to resolve most of the problems as the RA.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Here, to show off my algorithm skill, i did apply the disjoin set to mitigate the gas fee. Certainly, when user did some query, it has to perform a lot of recursive function in the block-chain, to find the newest version of the blog, so here i propsosed to use the disjoin set to map the old version to the newest version treat them as the same node.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Unpublished Project:\n",
    "        - To be honest, this project have not published yet and been postponed. I openen the project with intention to learn more about the django, training model and scoring the algorithm code. Certainly, I splitted the project into 2 parts, one was web part and one was model part. The web part mainly was designed as some algorithm training platform like codeforces, hackerank, leetcode, ... but the difference that I want to use model to generate code to solve the all problem in the database and learn from the submitted code. The model part was used for training model and build prediction services. In first phrase, we mostly focused on the web development, studying about the django and improving the system design. In this phrase, I did some basic set-up with django like DB, cache server, extensions and I haved just finished building crontab to harvesting data from web and pushing it into kafka and scheduled it 'til the project was closed because of the thesis project. My purpose was used a crontab to crawl data and push to kafka, then use another scheduled crontab to poll the data in kafka store it into cache system then using the slow database strategy to store the data into database. then kafka not only was used for that process."
